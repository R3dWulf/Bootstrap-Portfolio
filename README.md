# Bootstrap-Portfolio

In this assignment the basic portfolio from the previous week is redone with bootstrap templates and other css features. Bootsrap allows 
for better site response across different screen sizes by not having to manually set the CSS needed to do so. Other bootstrap features
allow for a one-stop shop for better web site layout and design.
